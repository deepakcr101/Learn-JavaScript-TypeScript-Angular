    <h1>Async/Await in JavaScript</h1>
    <p>This page demonstrates the use of async/await in JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations.</p>
    <h2>What is Async/Await?</h2>
    <p>Async/await is a syntactic sugar built on top of Promises in JavaScript. It allows you to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code, making it easier to read and maintain.</p>
    <h3>Why Use Async/Await?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Improved Readability:</strong> Async/await provides a cleaner and more readable syntax for handling asynchronous code compared to Promises and callbacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Async/await allows for better error handling using try/catch blocks, making it easier to manage errors in asynchronous code.</li>
        <li><strong>Sequential Operations:</strong> Async/await makes it easier to write sequential asynchronous operations without deeply nested callbacks or complex Promise chains.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Use Cases:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>API Calls: Fetching data from a server.</li>
        <li>File Operations: Reading or writing files asynchronously.</li>
        <li>Database Operations: Performing database queries asynchronously.</li>
        <li>Network Requests: Handling HTTP requests and responses.</li>
        <li>Timeouts and Delays: Managing asynchronous delays in execution using setTimeout.</li>
        <li>Parallel Operations: Using Promise.all to wait for multiple promises to resolve.</li>
    </ul>
