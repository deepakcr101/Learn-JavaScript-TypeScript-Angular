    <h1>JavaScript Promises</h1>
    <p>This page demonstrates the use of Promises in JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations.</p>
    <h2>What are Promises?</h2>
    <p>Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.</p>
    <p>Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They act as placeholders for data that will be available in the future.</p>

    <p>Promises have three states:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pending:</strong> The initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.</li>
        <li><strong>Fulfilled:</strong> The operation completed successfully, and the promise has a value.</li>
        <li><strong>Rejected:</strong> The operation failed, and the promise has a reason for the failure.</li>
    </ul>
