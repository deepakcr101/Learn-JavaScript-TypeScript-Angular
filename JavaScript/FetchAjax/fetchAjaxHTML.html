    <h1>JavaScript Fetch and AJAX Concepts</h1>
    <p>AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique for creating fast and dynamic web pages. It allows web
        pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes. This
        means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Concepts of AJAX</h2>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Asynchronous:</strong> AJAX allows for asynchronous communication with the server, meaning that
                the user can continue to interact with the page while data is being fetched or sent.</li>
            <li><strong>XMLHttpRequest:</strong> The traditional way to make AJAX requests is using the XMLHttpRequest
                object, which provides methods to send HTTP requests and handle responses.</li>
            <li><strong>Fetch API:</strong> A modern alternative to XMLHttpRequest, the Fetch API provides a more
                powerful and flexible way to make AJAX requests using promises.</li>
            <li><strong>JSON:</strong> JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a common format for exchanging data between
                the client and server in AJAX applications.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Using Fetch API for AJAX</h2>
    <p>The Fetch API provides a modern and flexible way to make AJAX requests. It uses promises, which allows for
        easier handling of asynchronous operations. Here’s a basic example of how to use the Fetch API:</p>
    <pre><code>
      fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
          console.log(data);
        })
        .catch(error => {
          console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
        });
    </code></pre>
    <p>In this example, we are fetching data from an API endpoint. The response is converted to JSON format, and then
        the data is logged to the console. If there is an error during the fetch operation, it is caught and logged as
        well.</p>

        <h3>What is AJAX?</h3>
AJAX is a technique for making asynchronous HTTP requests using the XMLHttpRequest object. It was widely used before the Fetch API was introduced.
<h4>Why Use AJAX?</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Legacy Support:</strong> Works in older browsers that don’t support Fetch API.</li>
    <li><strong>Asynchronous Requests:</strong> Fetch data without reloading the page.</li>
</ul>

<ul><strong>Use Cases</strong>
   <li>Fetching Data: Retrieve data from APIs in older systems.</li>
   <li>Sending Data: Send form data or JSON to servers.</li>
   <li>Partial Updates: Update parts of a webpage dynamically.</li>
   <li>Sending Data: Send form data or JSON to servers.</li>
   <li>Partial Updates: Update parts of a webpage dynamically.</li>
</ul>
