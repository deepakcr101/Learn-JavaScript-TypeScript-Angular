  <!-- <h3>Types of Components in Angularr:</h3>
  <ul>
    
<li>1. **Root Component**: This is the main component that Angular creates and inserts into the index.html host web page. It is typically named `AppComponent` and serves as the entry point for the application.</li>
<li>2. **Feature Components**: These components are created to represent specific features or sections of the application. They are usually organized in a hierarchical structure under the root component.</li>
<li>3. **Shared Components**: These components are designed to be reusable across different parts of the application. They often contain common UI elements or functionality that can be shared among multiple feature components.</li>
<li>4. **Service Components**: These are not components in the traditional sense but are Angular services that provide specific functionality or data to components. They are typically used for handling business logic, data retrieval, and state management.</li>
<li>5. **Directive Components**: These components are used to create custom directives that can be applied to elements in the template to modify their behavior or appearance.</li> 
  </ul>-->
